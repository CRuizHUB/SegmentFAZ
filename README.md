# SegmentFAZ
OCT-A Scanning utility for FAZ segmentation and further analysis.

Instructions:

Move main.py to the folder where the .tif OCT-A scans are, as well as the binary masks in .JPG format are. (If error checkings are not desired, simply create black .jpg images with the same names as the .tif files).

The other .py files are different, earlier implementations of the final algorithms.
